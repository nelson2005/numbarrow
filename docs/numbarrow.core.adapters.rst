numbarrow.core.adapters
=======================

Overview
++++++++

Type-dispatched adapters that convert PyArrow arrays into NumPy arrays
for use in Numba ``@njit`` compiled functions.

Uses ``functools.singledispatch`` to route each PyArrow array type to a
handler that extracts the underlying data buffer as a NumPy view (where
possible) and the validity bitmap as a uint8 array.

Supported types:

- ``BooleanArray`` (requires copy due to bit-packed layout)
- ``Int32Array``, ``Int64Array``, ``DoubleArray``, ``UInt8Array`` (zero-copy view)
- ``Date32Array`` (copy: int32 days → datetime64[D])
- ``Date64Array`` (zero-copy view as datetime64[ms])
- ``TimestampArray`` (zero-copy view as datetime64[unit])
- ``StringArray``, ``LargeStringArray`` (tuple of bitmap and a copy of data into a
  fixed-width NumPy Unicode array, whose width counts characters)
- ``StructArray`` (returns a 3-tuple: the struct-level validity bitmap, then bitmaps
  and data as two dicts keyed by field name)
- ``ListArray`` of structs (delegates to the StructArray adapter, honouring the list
  array's own offset; any other element type raises ``NotImplementedError``). The
  elements are flattened and no offsets are returned, so a null outer row is not
  reported and shifts the element-to-row mapping; do not pass a list column whose
  ``null_count`` is non-zero.

A row that is null as a whole carries no validity bits in its fields, so the
struct-level bitmap is the only record of it. Pass both layers to
``numbarrow.core.is_null.is_null_struct``.

A string value whose last character is NUL comes back without it: numpy's
fixed-width ``|U`` dtype pads with NUL, so a trailing NUL cannot be told from
padding. Interior NULs are preserved.

Returned data arrays are read-only, since they view Arrow buffers the caller
does not own, which is what ``pyarrow.Array.to_numpy(zero_copy_only=True)``
returns as well. Declare numba signatures that receive them with
``readonly=True``, which accepts writable arrays too. Returned bitmaps own
their memory and are writable.
